Description: translations for Qt 6
 Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt's primary feature
 is its rich set of widgets that provide standard GUI functionality.
 .
 This package provides translation files for Qt itself and some base apps,
 such as Qt Linguist, Qt Assistant and Qt Designer.
